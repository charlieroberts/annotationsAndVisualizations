        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>In this web essay I present research on dynamically injecting realtime annotations and visualizations into a programming environment for live coding performance. The techniques I describe enable both performers and audiences to gain greater insight into discrete events, continuous signals, and the algorithmic transformation of musical pattern. I catalog these techniques and encourage readers to interactively experiment with each of them, and conclude by describing challenges and future directions for this line of research.</p>

        <p><em>NOTE: The examples in this essay currently only work in Chrome. I'm working on it!</em></p>

				<h3 class="title">Introduction</h3>
        <p>This web essay will explore the addition of annotations and visualizations to custom-developed programming environments for <a href="http://toplap.org/about">live coding performance</a>; in this essay I will use the term 'live coding' to refer to the digital arts practice, as opposed to live programming more generally.  I provide a catalogue of techniques I've developed to help reveal algorithmic activity to both audience members and programmer/performers. These techniques are implemented in standard JavaScript, which is also the end-user language; however, many are generalizable and some have drawn inspiration from features found in programming environments for other languages. The code examples below are <em>live</em>; feel free to make minor edits and view / listen to the resulting changes. In addition to pressing the 'Play' button, which selects all code in a given example and runs it, you can also highlight code you'd like to execute and hit Ctrl+Enter.</p>

        <p>Before diving in, I'd like to provide an example of what many of these annotations look like when combined, as shown in Listing 1. Although they might be somewhat overwhelming when simultaneously viewed, in my experience they can provide valuable scaffolding to the development of a program as it is written over time.</p>

				<h3 class="title">Motivation</h3>
        <p>The initial motivation for this research was to improve audience understanding of live coding performances, where source code is written on stage and often projected for the audience to follow. However, over time the feedback provided by the annotations and visualizations described also became important to my personal performance practice [<a href="http://https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14794713.2016.1227602?journalCode=rpdm20">7</a>]. The feedback provides important indications of activity, and a quick way to visually confirm that algorithms are proceeding as intended. A survey I conducted with over a hundred live coders and computer scientists indicated a high level of interest in the types of annotations presented here [<a href="http://www.charlie-roberts.com/pubs/gibber.annotations.pdf" target=_blank>1</a>].</p>

        <p>Although parts of this research have been previously presented to the digital arts community, my goal in describing it to the LIVE community is to obtain feedback from a broader community of computer scientists with interests in the psychology of programming and in novel techniques for interactive programming environments. There are also a number of new techniques presented in this essay for the first time. Finally, I believe that the web essay format is fundamentally the best vehicle for presenting this research, as the animated/temporal characteristics of the annotations and visualizations are difficult to convey in static text and images, such as in the papers I have previously published on the subject.</p>

        <p>Outside of informal, high-level descriptions, I do not explain the code or APIs used in the examples. The focus is instead on how algorithms are annotated / visualized, and I provide only the minimal explanation necessary to understand our design decisions in this regard. While my research to date has focused on implementation and evaluation in the context of our personal artistic practice, I look forward to more formal user evaluations in the future, and are particuarly interested in implications for teaching computational media.</p> 
			</section>


      <section class="container" id="Principles">
      <h3 class="title">Guiding principles</h3>
      <p>There are three principles that guide the design of the presented annotations and visualizations.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>If a value changes over time (typically related to musical progression or signal processing), display its current state, either by adding a visualization / annotation  or by modifying the source code to reflect the current value.</li>
        <li>Make annotations and visualizations as proximal as possible to the code fragment responsible for generating the data they are representing.</li>
        <li>In addition to displaying when values change, whenever possible also provide some indication of when a value is being <em>read</em>, in particular when there is a direct affect on musical / sonic output.
      </ol>

      <p>The first principle is fundamentally constrained by screen real estate; therefore, only the current state of variables found in code within the editing environment's current viewport is actively displayed. However, this is still very different from environments where time-varying variables must be explicitly 'watched' by the programmer. By displaying all updates concurrently, audience members can choose the algorithms they'd like to watch develop, and the time programmer/performers must spend on user interactions for viewing state is minimized.</p>

      <p>In regards to the second principle, the types of data that can be easily represented inside of an editing environment constrain annotations and visualizations. It is easy to display short sequences of musical data outputted by a generative algorithm inside of the editor; it is more difficult to display sequences that are thousands of values in length. While I can readily imagine use cases where longer sequences are musically useful, in the environments I work on shorter sequences are more common during typical use.</p>

      <p>With these three principles in mind, the next section describes a variety of annotations and visualization that I, and other users, have found useful in the context of live coding performances.</p>

        <h3>Catalog of techniques</h3>
        <p>This research augments programming interfaces to include visualizations, self-modifying source code, automated annotations via inserted code comments, and a variety of other techniques. By injecting annotations and visualizations into the source code itself, we improve association between code and the annotations / visualizations depicting its effects. This placement of visualizations, characterized as <em>in situ</em> by Hofswell et. al, [<a href='https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jhoffs/papers/2018-AugmentingCode-CHI.pdf' target=_blank>2</a> ] has been shown to aid in the understanding of programs</a> under certain conditions, which is intuitive following Gestalt principles of proximity.</p> 

        <h4 class='title'>Repeating static values</h5>
        <p>The simplest annotation added to our environment is a rotating border around static elements that are accessed repeatedly. The rotation provides a visual indication of when the values are used. Survey results indicated that rotation was preferable to other techniques (such as flashing) due to its less distracting nature [<a href="http://www.charlie-roberts.com/pubs/gibber.annotations.pdf" target=_blank>1</a>].</p>
        
        <p>Listing 2 shows a repeated scale index (0) being triggered every quarter note. We'll see how this simple annotation can be useful in combination with others in the next section.</p>

        <div id='static1' class='example' caption='Listing 2: Rotating borders indicating actvity.'>
          <div class='editor'>
syn = Synth('bleep')
syn.note.seq( 0, 1/4 )
          </div> 
        </div>

        <p>It is worth noting that 'distracting' flashes can also be used to great effect; in the live-coding environment SchemeBricks by Dave Griffith blocks flash whenever they receive a control signal, providing an indication of activity with greater spectacle.</p>

      <section class='container code' >
        <h4 class='title'>Cycling through musical patterns</h5>
        <p>Musical patterns (aka sets) are common ways of expressing lists that can be transformed and manipulated algorithmically.
        However, even if a pattern is read from start to finish without modification, it can still be useful to know which elements of
        the pattern are being triggered when, so that programmers and audience members can associate the the values being triggered with
        the corresponding sonic results.</p>

        <p>In Listing 3, a synthesizer plays a simple pattern that loops through the seven notes of a standard scale from Western harmony. In addition to this melodic pattern, a rhythmic pattern alternates between quarter notes and eighth notes in duration.</p>

        <div id='array1' class='example' caption='Listing 3: Revealing the phase of musical patterns.'>
          <div class='editor'>
syn = Synth('bleep')
syn.note.seq( [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7], [1/4,1/8] )
          </div> 
        </div>

        <p>The potential of this method is more apparent when the pattern is not playing sequentially. In Listing 4, scale indices are randomly chosen. Also note that the rotating border annotation now provides a indication of how many times a randomly chosen value has been repeated in a row (modulo 4). </p>

        <div id='array2' class='example' caption='Listing 4: Highlighting randomly selected members of patterns.'>
          <div class='editor'>
syn = Synth('bleep')
syn.note.seq( [0,3,7].rnd(), 1/8 )
          </div> 
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class='container code' >
        <h4 class='title'>Pattern transformations</h5>
        <p>20th-century serialist techniques transform musical pattern using many techniques, including reversal, rotation, inversion, and scaling. I was inspired by Thor Magnussons's ixi lang environment [<a href="http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/46869/1/ixi_lang_02.pdf">3</a>] to depict these transformations within the code itself, clearly revealing how patterns are transformed over time. The video below shows the effect of this technique in an ixi lang recreation of Steve Reich's composition <em>Piano Phase</em>.</p>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/14964509" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/14964509">ixi lang take on Steve Reich&#039;s Piano Phase</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/ixi">ixi audio</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

        <p>In Listing 5, a percussion pattern is played against a steady kick drum rhythm. Each of the symbols in the percussion pattern denotes a different sound that is played; this pattern is then rotated one position after every measure, creating varying rhythms against the constant kick drum.</p>

        <div id='transform1' class='example' caption='Listing 5: Displaying pattern transformations'>
          <div class='editor'>
kick = Kick('tight').trigger.seq( .75, 1/4 )

drums = Drums('x*ox*xo-', 1/8, { pitch:8, gain:.5 })
drums.seq.values.rotate.seq( 1,1 )
          </div> 
        </div>

        <p>The code in Listing 5 is more complex than the previous examples in this essay, providing an opportunity to see how two different instruments rhythmically relate to each other and also view transformations in musical pattern. It is perhaps worth comparing the example given above to the exact same code without annotations, shown in Listing 6, in order to gauge how annotations affect perception of / engagement with code.</p>
        <div id='transform2' class='example' caption='Listing 6: This example is the same as Listing 5, but without using any annotations.'>
          <div class='editor'>
kick = Kick('tight').trigger.seq( .75, 1/4 )

drums = Drums('x*ox*xo-', 1/8, { pitch:8, gain:.5 })
drums.seq.values.rotate.seq( 1,1 )
          </div> 
        </div>

      <section class='container code' >
        <h4 class='title'>Revealing 'hidden' data and function output</h5>
        <p>As we saw from prior examples, we can highlight selected members of patterns as they are selected / triggered. However, this assumes that the pattern has been fully notated, with all its members included in the source code document. But it is natural to assume that in algorithmic music the source material for musical patterns will likely be defined algorithmically, as opposed to manually entered by a programmer/perfomer.</p>

        <p>In such instances pattern generators are present in the source code as opposed to the data that they generate; the generated patterns are hidden. Our solution to this problem is to present these patterns in code comments adjacent to the code representing the pattern generators responsible for creating them. In Listing 7, we'll use a 'Euclidean' rhythm, a terse description of a rhythmic pattern drawn from a well-known musicology paper by Godfried Toussaint [<a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/publications/banff.pdf" target=_blank>3</a>, where a given number of pulses are fit into a given number of slots using Bjorklund's algorithm. The results of running the Euclidean rhythm will determine the output of a kick drum. Whenever a zero is present in the pattern a rest will be triggered; a one (pulse) will trigger the kick drum.</p>
        <div id='euclid' class='example' caption='Listing 7: Revealing the output of pattern generators.'>
          <div class='editor'>
kick = Kick('tight').trigger.seq( .75, Euclid(5,8) ) 
          </div> 
        </div>

        <p>These generated patterns can also be transformed over time, with the results depicted in the associated code comments. Note that when playback stops the code comments are automatically cleared. Listing 8 shows comments used to display both the initial data generated by the Euclidean rhythm and its subsequent transformations. </p>
        <div id='euclid2' class='example' caption='Listing 8: Transforming the data created by a pattern generator.'>
          <div class='editor'>
// our first kick drum will play a steady beat
kick = Kick('tight').trigger.seq( .75, 1/4 )

// ...while our second will rotate over time
kick2 = Kick('tight').trigger.seq( .5, Euclid(6,16) )
kick2.trigger[0].timings.rotate.seq( 1,1 )
          </div> 
        </div>

        <p> In contrast to defining patterns that are known ahead of time, it is also useful to generate values on-the-fly throughout performance; in our environments this can be done by passing functions that generate values to sequence constructors. The same technique we described earlier in this section for annotating generated patterns (shown in Listings 7–8) can also be used to show the output of such functions. Listing 9 shows the output of a function which outputs integers between 0-10; these values are then used to trigger notes in a scale.</p>
       <div id='anonymous1' class='example' caption='Listing 9: Revealing the output of functions.'>
          <div class='editor'>
syn = Synth('bleep')
syn.note.seq( Rndi(0,10), 1/4 )
          </div> 
        </div>

        <p>We note that while Rndi (and Rndf) are included as convenience methods, there is nothing special about them in terms of annotations. The technique works for any function, enabling performers and students to experiment with writing their own generative functions while receiving visual feedback. Below we use an anonymous function that randomly returns a value of zero or one.</p>

        <div id='anonymous2' class='example' caption='Listing 10: Revealing the output of an anonymous function'>
          <div class='editor'>
syn = Synth('bleep')
syn.note.seq( ()=> Math.round( Math.random() ), 1/4 )
          </div> 
        </div>

      </section>

      <section class='container code' >
        <h4 class='title'>Visualizing continuous data</h5>
        <p>The previous examples have all featured data that is discrete; for example, notes are triggered at particular moments in time, as are pattern transformations and many other types of events. However, the musical world is divided into discrete and continuous data. An individual note might begin in a single moment but the expressive characteristics of that note, such as vibrato, are determined continuously over the note's duration.</p>

        <p>During the development of gibberwocky, a live coding environment that targets external musical applications, my collaborator Graham Wakefield and I added affordances for defining continuous signals and sequencing changes to their parameters over time. In some live coding performances, I noticed that I often spent time at the beginning programming discrete events and patterns, and then segued to creating continuous manipulations of these events. Put another way, many performances consisted of initially creating patterns, and then subsequently adding expressive nuance to them. However, at the time there were no affordances in our environment for displaying continuous signals, which led to a suddent lack of visual feedback during performances when continuous controls were being programmed. In order to correct this we added a simple visualization showing the output of generated signals. In Listing 11, a synth slowly moves through the left/right stereo spectrum based on the output of a sine oscillator.</p>

        <div id='sparklines1' class='example' caption='Listing 11: Visualizing a continuous signal in situ.'>
          <div class='editor'>
syn = Synth('bleep', { panVoices:true })
syn.note.seq( 0, 1/8 )

// create a sine oscillator in the range of {0,1}
sine = gen( add( .5, mul( cycle(.5), .5 ) ) )

syn.pan = sine
          </div> 
        </div>

        <p>Although we initially used sparklines for these visualizations, we subsequently found that including the output range of the signals greatly improved their usefulness. One interesting point to note is that the output ranges are dynamic, based off an analysis of the generated signal. This means that if the signal range changes by a significant factor, the visualization will update itself to reflect the current average output range; this behavior can be seen in the first example found in this essay.</p>

        <p>However, for certain types of signals portraying the current window and its adjusted range proves problematic. Consider the ambient piece presented below, created using gibberwocky by performer <a href="http://lukasnowok.org">Lukas Nowok</a>. The piece primarily consists of long gestures, many slowly evolving over hundreds of musical measures; most of these gestures are simple fades of sonic parameters. Visualizing a short window of these fades yields flat lines that slowly rise vertically, and fails capture the gesture of the fade or really provide any useful information at all, revealing limitations in our generalized approach to displaying audio signals. </p>

       <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gl4JLCkbrfU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe> 
        
        <p>
Because the gesture of a fade is so common in music programming, I implemented a simple visualization that displays the starting point and ending points of the fade and a line connecting them; an animation then shows the progress from the start to the end. Upon completion of the fade both the corresponding modulation and the visualization representing it are cleared.</p>

        <div id='fade' class='example' caption='Listing 12: Visualizing a parameter fade.'>
          <div class='editor'>
syn = Synth('bleep')
syn.note.seq( 0, 1/8 )
// fade from 0 to .75 over 8 measures
syn.gain.fade( 0, .75, 8 ) 
          </div> 
        </div>



        <p>A notable precursor using in situ visualizations in environments for live coding performance is described by Swift et. al for the Impromptu environment [<a href="https://eprints.qut.edu.au/61525/1/liveannotations.pdf">4</a>]. The image below, taken from the paper describing the work, shows two 'clocks' depicting the amount of time remaining before a recursive function next calls itself.</p>

      <section class='container code' >
        <h4 class='title'>Mixing continuous and discrete information</h5>
        <p>An idiomatic generative technique of electronic music is to <em>sample-and-hold</em> a continuous signal, effectively turning it into a discrete one. Instead of visualizing the resulting stepped signal, I chose instead to visualize the continuous signal before it is sampled, and then depict the points where sampling occurs. In this way both the discrete events and continuous signals that are being generated are visualized. In the example below, a sine oscillator generates a signal which is then sampled over time based on an Euclidean rhythm. These sampled values are then used to look up notes in a musical scale, which are then fed to a bass synthesizer.</p>

        <h3>Challenges and Conclusions</h3>
        <p>The biggest challenge in developing these techniques is simply the time it takes to figure out the most efficient way to markup the source code so that annotations and visualizations are possible. Using a dynamic language like JavaScript makes markup more difficult, as there are a wide variety of different ways to accomplish a given task, and the annotations / visualizations need to be able to respond appropriately to each of them. Because of this, it is only over the last two years or so that I've enabled these features by default in the programming environments; up until that point they were strictly 'opt-in' for people that weren't afraid of the possible errors that they might incur. Moving the annotations to a more constrained, domain-specific language should provide for greater safety and ease future development of these techniques.</p>

        <p>Another challenge is that some data lends itself better to this type of depiction than others. For example, if I use a function that generates an array of a thousand random numbers, it becomes quite impractical to display every output value inside the code editor in comments. Similarly, it is difficult to perceive change in continuous signals with extremely low frequncies; in many types of music modulations lasting over a minute in length are quite common, and hard to depict using the automated techniques described here.</p>

        <p>But, in the end, the feedback provided by these annotations and visualizations have become a critical part of my live coding practice. Audience members often tell me how much they appreciate the feedback provided by the visualizations and annotations, and, in some cases, describe how it improved their ability to understand what was happening during the performance. I am optimistic that the robustness of these techniques can be improved so that they can be applied to a wider variety of live coding environments in the future.</p>
